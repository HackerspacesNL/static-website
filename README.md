## Hugo rebuild of hackerspaces.nl

The Hackerspaces.nl website has been wordpress upto this point, and we really would like to get rid of this overly complex pile of PHP code. This repository holds a rebuild of the
website using Hugo to create a static version of the website.

### Currently implemented

- Most of the 'fixed' pages
- The Map of the hackerspaces
- Integration of the rss-feeds (processed manually at this time)
- Client-side search (/search)

### Still missing

- Fixing layout/design/styling, currently using 'papermod' theme
- Mediatheek page links, and fixing dead links there
- Automated deployment workflow
- Method to publish / preview drafts
