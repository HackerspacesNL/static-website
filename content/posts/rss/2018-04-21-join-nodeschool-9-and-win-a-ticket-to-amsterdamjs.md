<p>It’s been a while, but we’re back! Our space had some renovation, which now allows us to do a workshop downstairs and a freeform upstairs if you want.</p>

<h2 id="workshop">Workshop</h2>

<p>Instead of creating a traditional API using REST (a way to create a webserver and serve data to a website), we’ll be looking at GraphQL. This is a technology that has been picked up by larger companies, which allows you to do actual quering of your data.</p>

<p>Don’t worry if you didn’t really get that! We’ll be able to help everyone out, whether you’re a beginning with programming or somebody that already start doing NodeJS development.</p>

<h2 id="freeform">Freeform</h2>

<p>Want to show of your project? Or need help with your project? It doesn’t need to be related to GraphQL - but that would be nice. Talk, learn and do projects with others.</p>
