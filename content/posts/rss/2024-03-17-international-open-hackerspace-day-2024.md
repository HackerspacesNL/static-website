<p>It is almost that time of the year again that all hackerspaces will open their doors! 30th of March is the International Open Hackerspace Day and Pixelbar will be open for everyone this day!</p>

<p>Never been to a hackerspace yet? Curious where Pixelbar is located after the fire? Do you want to see what kind of tools we have which you can use when you visit us? Want to look what awesome projects our participants have been working on?</p>

<p>Participants of Pixelbar will be happy to answer your questions, show off their projects and maybe even help with a project that you bring along.</p>

<p>Pixelbar can be found at the Schiehaven 15c in Rotterdam. We are open from 12:00 till 17:00. After these hours some of our participants will be still in Pixelbar, to be sure if we are still open visit our website on www.pixelbar.nl and on the top you can see if we are open or not. When you can’t visit us on the 30th of March then you’re always welcome to visit us on Wednesdays or Saturdays, check on our website whether we’re open or closed.</p>
