<p>It is almost that time of the year again that all Hackerspaces will open their doors!
25th of March is the International Open Hackerspace Day and Pixelbar will release ALL the locks we don’t have any locks for the public but i need to make an awesome marketing text to get you interested</p>

<p>Never been to a hackerspace yet? Curious what happens behind the doors? Do all hackers have black screens with green lines of code? Is this USB i’ve found safe to put in my laptop?</p>

<p>Participants of Pixelbar will be happy to answer your questions, show off their projects and maybe even help with a project that you bring along.</p>

<p>Pixelbar can be found at the Vierhavensstraat 56 in Rotterdam in the Keilewerf building.
We are open from 12:00 till 17:00. After these hours some of our participants will be still in Pixelbar, to be sure if we are still open visit our website on www.pixelbar.nl and on the top you can see if we are open or not. When you can’t visit us on the 25th of March then you’re always welcome to visit us on Wednesdays or Saturdays, check on our website whether we’re open or closed.</p>
