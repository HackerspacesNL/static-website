<p>We’re hosting the first NodeSchool in Rotterdam. <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a> are hosted open source workshops that teach web software skills. And best of all… they’re free.</p>

<p><a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> is a popular, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of tools and applications. This first edition will be focussing on the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript (ES6)</a> with Node.</p>

<p>Let’s see whether people in Rotterdam are interested to learn writing software.</p>

<p>We’re planning to organise this every month. The first edition is already full, but when you signup on meetup.com, you’ll be notified when the next one is announced.</p>
