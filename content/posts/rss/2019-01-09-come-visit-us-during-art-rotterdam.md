<p>During Art Rotterdam, on the 9th of February the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/408043403069709/">Keilewerf will open its doors</a>. It the breeding ground for creative entrepreneurs in Rotterdam, divided over 2 buildings with a total of 6000m2. The Keilewerf is a place for steelbenders, artist, furniture makers, musicians and ofcourse hackers. Pixelbar is located in The Keilewerf, so we’ll be opening our doors to the public too!</p>

<p><strong>You can find us at the Keilewerf 1 and visit us from 13:00 until at least 17:00.</strong></p>

<p>During these hours we will show off our projects, and might even invite you to do some soldering, programming, hacking and/or play a game with our VR goggles. If you have your own small project, just bring it! There is plenty of room in our hackerspace to work on it. And if you really enjoy your time here, you can even become a member!</p>

<p>In the evening there might be some participants left, so don’t hesitate to drop by if you don’t make it before 17:00. On the top of this page you can see whether the space is opened (or simply ask us in <a href="https://www.pixelbar.nl/contact/">our chat</a>).</p>

<p>There is no need to sign up, just come by. When the doors are closed, just push the big red button on the door in the middle of the building and someone will come to open the door.</p>

<p>When you can’t visit us on the 9th of February then you’re always welcome to visit us on Wednesdays or Saturdays, check on our website whether we’re open or closed.</p>
