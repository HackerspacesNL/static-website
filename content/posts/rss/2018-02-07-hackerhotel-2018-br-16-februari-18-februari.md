<p>After 2 previous editions, HackerHotel will be back again in 2018. This year Pixelbar will join this awesome hacking/security conference with around 10 participants.</p>

<p>HackerHotel is an event which not only hosts technical and informational talks, but there will also be some space to hack around a bit with led panels, arduino’s, lockpinging, soldering, programming,… you name it.</p>

<p>One of our members (Miep) is even having a talk about decryption of ssl traffic. You could say, Pixelbar is surely to be found at the event!</p>

<p>Will we see you there? We’ll bring stickers!</p>
