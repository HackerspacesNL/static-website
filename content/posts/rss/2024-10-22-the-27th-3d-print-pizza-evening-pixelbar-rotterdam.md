<p>Are you interested in 3D printing? Whether you have yet to buy your first 3D printer or already have an entire print farm, the 3D Print &amp; Pizza Meetup is the perfect opportunity to meet like-minded individuals and share your passion. Everyone with an interest in 3D printing is welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Workshop: The basics of Fusion 360 for 3D printing</strong></p>

<p>This time Michel (Relions3D) will be giving a workshop in Fusion 360. This workshop will focus on the basics of parametric design for 3D printing.</p>

<p>After a short presentation you will get to play around in Fusion with the help of Michel and others. So bring a laptop and an idea.</p>

<p><strong>What to expect</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Show and Tell</strong>: Have you printed something cool? Feel free to bring it along to show it off or maybe ask for feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: Having problems with your 3D printer? Bring it along, and maybe others can help you solve the issue. Bringing something is not mandatory, but it often starts a good conversation.</li>
  <li><strong>Presentations and Workshops</strong>: Want to give a presentation or organize a workshop? The meetup offers a platform for everyone to share knowledge. Discuss with the venue in advance if you need any extra equipment.</li>
</ul>
