2013/09/07 - Just a quick update, since it’s been a while since the last blog post
We’ve been extremely busy organising OHM2013. There will be plenty of content after OHM2013 is done as Bitlair members together with other members of Team:LOC (Light Operations Centre) have created an awesome lighting system.
</p><p>Other Bitlair members are in Team:NOC (Network Operations Centre), and have been busy planning, configuring and splicing fibre-optic cables.
</p><p>Well, that is all for now.. don’t forget to visit OHM2013! <a class="external free" href="https://ohm2013.org/" rel="nofollow">https://ohm2013.org/</a>
