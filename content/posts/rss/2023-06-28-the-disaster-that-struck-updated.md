<p>Wednesday, June 28th, at around 8:00 AM, we received distressing messages notifying us that the building housing Pixelbar was engulfed in flames. This building was not only a home to artists, furniture makers, and other builders, but it was also the heart of our community. The fire has had a devastating impact, reducing the entire structure to ashes. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.</p>

<p>The incident has left our community in a state of shock, as we have suffered the irreplaceable loss of not just our physical space, but also all the equipment, tools, and projects we had  gathered over the course of 8 years.</p>

<p>All the support has been heartwarming, but we still have a long way to go. We are determined to rebuild our hackerspace, keeping our mission alive. We are looking for equipment (supplies, tools, etc) and donations to rebuild our hackerspace to its former glory. Any contribution, no matter how big or small, will make a tremendous difference in our ability to rebuild.</p>
