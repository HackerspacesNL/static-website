<p>Are you interested in 3D printing? Whether you have yet to buy your first 3D printer or already have an entire print farm, the 3D Print &amp; Pizza Meetup is the perfect opportunity to meet like-minded individuals and share your passion. Everyone with an interest in 3D printing is welcome!</p>

<p><strong>What to expect</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Show and Tell</strong>: Have you printed something cool? Feel free to bring it along to show it off or maybe ask for feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: Having problems with your 3D printer? Bring it along, and maybe others can help you solve the issue. Bringing something is not mandatory, but it often starts a good conversation.</li>
  <li><strong>Presentations and Workshops</strong>: Want to give a presentation or organize a workshop? The meetup offers a platform for everyone to share knowledge. Discuss with the venue in advance if you need any extra equipment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Location</strong><br />
3D Print and Pizza Rotterdam is hosted at Hackerspace Pixelbar. We are at Schiemond 20, 3024 EE Rotterdam. This is inside “De Kroon”, follow the signs for K14.</p>

<p>If you’re coming with public transportation: you can go to Tram stop Schiemond or Metro Station Delfshaven and then walk towards the harbor.</p>

<p>To access the space you need to go up a set stairs, we sadly don’t have an elevator.</p>
