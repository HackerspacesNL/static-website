<p>After the big fire we had to cancel and never thought we could get up and running this fast. 
But we got offered a temporary space nearby! Thanks to Buurman Rotterdam for arranging this awesome place we can continue doing what we love!</p>

<p>So no cancelation of the Print &amp; Pizza Night. Everyone is welcome with an interest in 3D Printing, advanced DIY-builder or owner of a print farm, or orientating interested person who has yet to buy his first printer? Everyone is welcome at the Print &amp; Pizza night hosted at Pixelbar in Rotterdam. 
Take your prints or even printer with you to show it to others, to ask questions about it if you have a problem. Together with the whole group you get tips, maybe someone can help you solve the problem and you get to know others with the same interest. And of course there will be pizza.</p>

<p>Location 3D print &amp; pizza evening is hosted at Hackerspace Pixelbar, which is located at (Keileweg 28, Rotterdam). 
There is (limited) parking space available. If you’re coming with public transportation: you can take the stop at Marconiplein and walk your way up towards the KFC and take a left into the Keileweg. After about 450 meters, you’ll be at our new building.</p>
