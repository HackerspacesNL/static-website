<p>Keilewerf has been around for 9 years and that is celebrated with an open day!
This year is a bit special because of the big fire, but you can still visit Pixelbar at the old location.
We are standing for the last time on the old fundament of Keilewerf 1 at our very own place.
This day is a celebration of renewal, resilience and building an inspiring community.</p>

<p>Learn more about our exciting technology and art projects, workshops and activities. Meet the participants of the Pixelbar Foundation and the entrepreneurs of the Keilewerf.</p>
